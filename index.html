  	<h2>ABOUT ME: DONOBAN</h2>
    <p>I am a die hard Raiders fan even if they go to Las Vegas. My height is 5'5 born 1987 I like to be very positive and always keep moving forward. I am married to my other half <em>ANDREA CALIXTO</em> we have two girls <em>Abril</em> and <em>Sury</em> they are my main motivation to keep learning and show them that nothing is impossible. I have my high school diploma before coming to the program I was advance tech support in TTECH GDL and the main reason why am here is like HOLACODE motto there is alot of talent but not opportunities you must always take adavantage of every thing that comes your way seize the moment.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>The cookie recipe was a practice on how to correctly place all of the tags on a HTML in correct order, indentation and to create a good work practice. This will help alot when we work in teams so that every body can read the code and not make mistakes. I struggled alot at first but with alot of thinking and studying I was able to grasp the lesson.</p>
    <br>
    <p> The other practice "hello world" was one of the best lessons this was my first ever website we said "hello world" to the world wide web this lesson was very mind blowing it showed me the capacities that we have with the talents that we are being taught by our tech mentors in HOLACODE.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The best for last the last lesson is what you get to see right now this is what we have been able to learn so far in only a week of being at HOLACODE. This is amazing to be able to show off what we have been able to catch, understand and comprehend I will let you guys be the judge THANK YOU FOR EVERY THING HOLACODE.</p>
